# Game Port: Gemini HTML to Next.js - Phase 1: Planning & Architecture

## Task Objective
Port the turnbasedpvemmo-gemini-alpha.html game from Gemini environment into a full-fledged, scalable Next.js application with chat rooms, DMs, and other features.

## Current State Assessment
- Original game exists as standalone HTML file with Firebase integration
- Current Next.js project has Starscape theme and basic structure
- Need to integrate game functionality while maintaining design consistency
- Requires Firebase setup, React component conversion, and state management

## Future State Goal
A complete, scalable Next.js game application with:
- Turn-based PvE MMO gameplay
- Real-time chat rooms and direct messaging
- Player authentication and profiles
- Town building and resource management
- Crafting and trading systems
- Responsive design with Starscape theme
- Database integration with Drizzle/PostgreSQL
- Real-time updates with WebSockets or Firebase

## Original Game Analysis

### Core Features Identified:
1. **Player System**: Stats (strength, stamina), skills, inventory, reputation, coins
2. **Town Building**: Shared town with objectives, treasury, upgrades
3. **Mission System**: Skills missions (gathering), combat missions, crafting
4. **Turn-based Actions**: 10-second cooldown system
5. **Resource Management**: Inventory, town treasury, contributions
6. **Progression**: Skill XP, town level, unlocked features
7. **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Firestore with live listeners

### Game Mechanics:
- **Cooldown System**: 10-second timer between actions
- **Mission Types**: Gathering, Combat, Crafting
- **Town Objectives**: Progressive unlocking of features
- **Resource Economy**: Player inventory â†” Town treasury
- **Skill Progression**: XP-based leveling system

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Project Analysis & Architecture Design âœ…
- [x] Analyze original HTML game structure and features
- [x] Design component architecture for Next.js
- [x] Plan database schema for players, towns, chat, etc.
- [x] Define API routes and real-time communication strategy
- [x] Create development roadmap with phases

### Step 2: Database & Backend Setup âœ…
- [x] Set up Drizzle schema for game entities
- [x] Create API routes for game actions
- [x] Implement authentication integration
- [x] Set up real-time communication (WebSockets or Firebase)
- [x] Create game state management system

### Step 3: Core Game Components ðŸš§
- [x] Convert main game interface to React components
- [x] Implement player dashboard and stats
- [ ] Create town building interface
- [ ] Build action system with cooldowns
- [ ] Add resource management and crafting

### Step 4: Social Features
- [ ] Implement chat room system
- [ ] Add direct messaging between players
- [ ] Create player profiles and friend system
- [ ] Build notification system

### Step 5: UI/UX Integration
- [ ] Apply Starscape theme to game components
- [ ] Ensure responsive design
- [ ] Add animations and visual feedback
- [ ] Implement accessibility features

### Step 6: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Unit tests for game logic
- [ ] Integration tests for real-time features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit and validation

### Step 7: Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Production deployment setup
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Error tracking and logging
- [ ] Documentation and user guides

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, Server Actions for game logic
- **Real-time**: WebSockets with Socket.io or Firebase Realtime Database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for game data
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js integration
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

### Scalability Factors
- **Horizontal scaling**: Stateless API routes
- **Caching**: Redis for session data and game state
- **Database**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Real-time**: WebSocket clustering for multiple instances

### Security Considerations
- **Input validation**: Zod schemas for all game actions
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
- **Authentication**: Secure session management
- **Data integrity**: Server-side validation for all game actions

## Database Schema Design âœ…

### Core Tables:
1. **players**: User profiles, stats, skills, inventory
2. **towns**: Shared town data, treasury, objectives
3. **missions**: Available missions and their requirements
4. **chat_rooms**: Public chat channels
5. **direct_messages**: Private conversations
6. **game_logs**: Player action history
7. **town_objectives**: Progressive town goals

### Relationships:
- Players belong to towns
- Missions are unlocked by town progress
- Chat messages reference players and rooms
- Game logs track all player actions

## Component Architecture âœ…

### Main Game Layout:
- **GameLayout**: Overall game container with navigation
- **PlayerPanel**: Left sidebar with player info, skills, inventory
- **TownPanel**: Town center and treasury
- **ActionPanel**: Mission boards and crafting
- **GameLog**: Real-time action feed

### Core Components:
- **PlayerStats**: Display player attributes and skills
- **MissionCard**: Individual mission display and interaction
- **InventoryGrid**: Resource management interface
- **TownObjective**: Progress tracking for town goals
- **CooldownTimer**: Action timing system
- **CraftingStation**: Recipe management and crafting

## Completed Work âœ…

### Database & Backend:
- [x] **Database Schema**: Complete Drizzle schema with all game tables
- [x] **Game Configuration**: Static game data (missions, recipes, objectives)
- [x] **Server Actions**: Core game logic (initialize, missions, town contributions)
- [x] **Authentication Integration**: Uses existing NextAuth system
- [x] **Game State Management**: Custom hook with polling for real-time updates

### Core Components:
- [x] **Game Layout**: Main game interface with navigation
- [x] **Game State Hook**: Real-time data management
- [x] **Icons**: Extended icon set for game interface
- [x] **Game Page**: Entry point with auth protection

### Integration:
- [x] **Theme Integration**: Uses existing Starscape theme
- [x] **Navigation**: Play button links to game page
- [x] **Auth Flow**: Seamless integration with existing auth

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Complete database schema and game configuration
2. âœ… Create initial game layout and state management
3. ðŸš§ **Current**: Implement remaining game components (PlayerPanel, TownPanel, ActionPanel, etc.)
4. Add real-time features and chat system
5. Polish UI/UX with Starscape theme
6. Testing and optimization
